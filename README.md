# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence for a given number of terms. The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms, and it generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

## Features
- Takes user input to determine how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence to generate.
- Implements input validation to ensure the user enters a valid, positive number.
- Optimized solution that only stores the previous two terms of the Fibonacci sequence, reducing memory usage.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone or Download the Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasanmertyilmaz/FibonacciCalculator.git
